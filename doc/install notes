first everything (testsw, python, sql driver) needs to be same bitness 32/64

I installed 32 bit python from python.org,
but this was probably a mistake
this code uses pandas and pyodbc, both were painful to install. see

anaconda is probably better
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/

Recommend installing vscode.

database driver needs to be installed.
from vscode terminal "py .\list_drivers.py"
and make sure drivers used are installed. Probably:
   "SQL Server"
   "Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb, *.accdb)"
