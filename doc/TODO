merlin, put files in csv?


how to make processing fast:

with a large number of files (maybe >10000) we will have to do 
something to reduce processing time.
Best, i think, is using stuff i've tried in 
try_keeping_file_list.py
using os.walk, read_csv, to_csv, and some logic to reduce to 
a small number of files to think about each time.
iterating thru directory listings will be slow.
